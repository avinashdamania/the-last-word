On the coast the activities are sea-oriented: fishing, fish drying and freezing. Some people are employees in public services in the main coastal villages. Before 1990 many Mahra were traders or shopkeepers in Koweit,  presently many migrated and settled in Saudi Arabia. A Mehri speaking community is settled in Tanzania and comes back regularly to Mahra. "
